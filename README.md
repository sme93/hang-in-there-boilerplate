## Introduction
The object of [Hang In There](https://sme93.github.io/hang-in-there-boilerplate/) is to give the user the ability to create new and interesting motivational-themed posters with an air of customizability. This project was created using solely JS to modify some pre-written HTML ([Project Specs Here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/hang-in-there.html)).

#### 
    
##  Step-By-Step
    Making Your Posters
1. First and foremost, the user will notice that they are greeted with a random poster upon their arrival at the main page. A random poster will also be generated any time the user refreshes the page or clicks on the dedicated random poster button `Show Another Random Poster`.

<img src="<img width="1016" alt="Show Another" src="![](readme-imgs/ShowAnotherRandom.png)">
">
</p>

2. Should the user want a little more control over their motivation, they need look no further than the `Make Your Own Poster` button at the right of the page. This button will take the user to a form that will allow them to enter a url to their own image, their own title, and motiviational quote, and (upon clicking the `Show my poster` button) will turn their input into a motivational poster of their own creation.

</p>


<p align = "center">
    "Show My Poster"
<img src="![](readme-imgs/ShowMyPosterButton.png)">
</p>


3. Whether by random generation or personal touch, once the user finds the perfect combination of title and quote transcribed below their preferred background, they are presented with the ability to save their creation with the `Save This Poster` button.

<p align = "center">
    "Save This Poster"
<img src="![](readme-imgs/SaveThisPoster.png)">
</p>

4. Once the user has created and saved one or more posters, any time they're lacking motivation they can find a miniaturized gallery of all their favorites by clicking the `Show Saved Posters` button on the main page.

<p align = "center">
    "Show Saved"
<img src="![](readme-imgs/ShowSaved.png)">
</p>

5. "But what happens if a poster that I originally thought was wonderful is actually *demotivating* me?". Well I'm glad you asked. If the user decides that they've outgrown the wisdom their once favorite poster could provide, they can remove it from their gallery by simply **double clicking** directly on the poster they'd like to delete within the `Show Saved Posters` gallery view.

    "Gallery View"

Remember, practice makes perfect! Don't be afraid to play around with your new found poster foundry power.
